# Skaifo Bingo
A basic bingo card generator for https://www.twitch.tv/skaifox streams. Modified from an older version of [alizarinred's vinesauce bingo](https://alizarinred.neocities.org/Bingo/Board.html).

### Available Categories
#### Generic:
- 20 skaifo tiles (19 in 24 chance)  
- 10 chat tiles (4 in 24 chance)  
- 10 donation tiles (1 in 24 chance)   
#### Nuzlocke
- 25 tiles (24 in 48 chance)  

## Adding new tiles
Tile lists are saved in [`tables`](tables) in a `js` file named for the category it's created for. New tiles can be added simply by inserting another string at the end of the array.

## Adding new categories
This is a little more in depth, so this is placeholder text until I write a proper step by step.
